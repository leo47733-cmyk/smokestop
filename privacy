    <h2>6. Logging by Firebase Services</h2>
    <p>We use Google Firebase as a technical platform. In the course of operating these services, the provider Google Ireland Limited automatically collects and stores technical log data (so‑called log files) relating to accesses and events.</p>
    <p>This includes in particular:
        <ul>
            <li>App usage events (via Firebase Analytics)</li>
            <li>Technical information about app crashes (via Firebase Crashlytics)</li>
            <li>Performance data such as load times (via Firebase Performance Monitoring)</li>
            <li>Meta‑information about API calls (e.g. time, type of request to Firestore or Authentication)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Processing by us is based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR) in ensuring stable, secure and improvable operation of our app.</p>
    <p><strong>The log data is stored by Google as our processor under Art. 28 GDPR. The storage period depends on the standard retention periods of the respective Firebase services. For example, Crashlytics data is usually retained for 90 days, and Performance data for 60 days. The log data is not merged by Google with your other user data (such as your progress).</strong></p>
    
    <h2>7. Analytics (Firebase Analytics)</h2>
    <p>The app uses Firebase Analytics from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland, to collect anonymised usage statistics (e.g. feature calls, session duration).</p>
    <p>When you first use the app, you will be informed about this analytics function and can give your consent. Processing only takes place on the basis of your consent under Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future in the app settings.</p>
    <p>The collected data cannot be directly attributed to a specific person and is not merged with other data sources.</p>

    <h2>8. Use of Processors</h2>
    <p>For technical provision we use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> For hosting, database and analytics (provider: Google Ireland Limited).</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For managing in‑app purchases and subscriptions (provider: RevenueCat, Inc., USA).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Processing is based on data processing agreements in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Transfers to Third Countries</h2>
    <p><strong>Through the use of our processors, data may be processed outside the EU/EEA.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase (Google Ireland Limited):</strong> For data transfers to the USA, Google has joined the <strong>EU‑US Data Privacy Framework (DPF)</strong>. The European Commission has issued an adequacy decision for the USA under the DPF, ensuring an adequate level of data protection.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat (RevenueCat, Inc., USA):</strong> Data transfer to the USA is based on <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses of the European Commission (SCCs)</strong>, which provide appropriate safeguards for data protection.</li>
    </ul>
